### 1-Description
A web app designed to explore Sequelize and Handlebars. The app takes in customer and burger names and stores them in a MySQL database. Each customer has a full status stored as a boolean, and each burger has a devoured status, also stored as a boolean. Each burger is associated to a customer with a foreign id key, and when the customer is deleted, all of their burgers are also deleted.

When a customer is full, they are removed from the order dropdown menu, and if they continue to eat, they have a (Math.floor(Math.random()) chance of exploding. If they explode, they are deleted from the database.

Clearly, this is a useless app on its own, but the structure could easily be adapted to create a comments section or a shared blog.
